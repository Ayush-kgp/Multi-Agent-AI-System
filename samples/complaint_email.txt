Subject: Dissatisfied with Recent Product Quality

To whom it may concern,

I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the quality of the product I received last week (Order #12345). This is the third time I have had issues with your products, and I am extremely frustrated with the situation.

The issues I've encountered include:
1. Poor build quality - the product shows signs of wear after just one week
2. Missing components - the package was missing two essential parts
3. Non-responsive customer service - my previous emails have gone unanswered

I have been a loyal customer for over two years, but these recurring issues are making me reconsider our business relationship. I expect either a full refund or a replacement product that meets the quality standards advertised on your website.

Please address this issue promptly. I will be forced to escalate this matter if I don't receive a satisfactory response within 48 hours.

Regards,
Sarah Johnson
